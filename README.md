## Features
![Desa Cantik](/docs/app-architecture.png)

- **Google Sheets Database**: Utilize Google Sheets as a database to easily update and manage data.
- **Next.js Frontend**: Build a responsive and fast front-end using Next.js, hosted on Vercel.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure your application with Firebase authentication.


## Roadmap
When data is bigger and need to be updated frequently, maybe we need to use database instead of google sheets because it will be slow to update the data
