## Introduction

This project is the result of my internship and aims to address the challenges of managing scattered data in villages, specifically focusing on poverty and disability data. To simplify the data management process and enhance accessibility, I've created a clean and intuitive dashboard with support for both light and dark modes, ensuring easy readability and navigation. 
The main goal of this project is to ensure the website remains continuously available and functional. To achieve this, I've decided not to implement a database or set up a server.

## Message

I want to convey a strong message about the importance of addressing poverty and disability issues in our villages. We must care about these challenges and work together to find solutions. The dashboard is not just a tool for data management; it's a platform to inspire action and change in our communities.

## Features

- Clean and intuitive user interface.
- Light and dark mode for improved readability.
- Seamless navigation for efficient data management.

## Technology Stack

- _Database_: Google Sheets
- _Web App_: Next.js
- _Hosting_: Vercel
- _Authentication_: Google OAuth with Firebase integration using NextAuth

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This application implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure the security of your data. There are four roles:

1. _Admin_: Admins have full control and can manage users and data.
2. _Editor_: Editors can read, update, and delete data.
3. _Viewer_: Viewers can read data.
4. _Guest_: Guests can only view macro or aggregate data.

## Usage

- Use the dashboard to manage and visualize poverty and disability data for villages.
- Explore the clean and user-friendly interface with light and dark modes.
- Navigate through the data effortlessly to streamline your data management tasks.
- Ensure users have appropriate roles to access and modify data.

## Roadmap

- When data is bigger and need to be updated frequently, maybe we need to use database instead of google sheets because it will be slow to update the data
